- Thanks giving is only for Allah and they only deserve it.
  - Here thanks means that the thing that was done freely and by that entity. meaning we're thanking Allah while they were not the one who did a good thing.
  - All thanks returns to Allah.
    - Allah gave us life, and many other blessings that we cannot even count.
    - Thus nobody has ever done anything good without Allah being involved in it somehow.
- Allah is representative of all other names God has.
  - Imam Ali told that Allah is the thing that when you have no hope in anything else and seek help from something, that thing is Allah.
- Why we thanks Allah?

  - To receive more blessings.
  - To see Allah bigger and more powerful than anything and anybody else.
  - To prevent us from committing sins since we only see Allah as the supreme being in this world.
  - Thanks God that we are not involved in flattering other human beings. Yes we will thanks those who Allah thanked too since it is done by Allah, so you could say that we are following their steps.
  - We understand who is great.

- Our praises we offer God cannot be considered complete in terms of being able to praise God to the extend that they deserve it.
- When we cannot comprehend Allah how is it possible for us to thanks God?
