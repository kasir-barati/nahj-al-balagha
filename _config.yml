  I am trying to translate in my own way what the priest is saying in the recorded meetings. It is just me hoping to help others see a different side of Shia. And this translation is not a professional translation and it is completely how I am trying to communicate ideas. So no credibility in what is written here. Just a starting point for those who wants to learn more.
